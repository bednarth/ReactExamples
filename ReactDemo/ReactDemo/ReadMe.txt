Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, 
and think about each piece in isolation. React.Component is provided by React.

The most important of these methods is called render 
which returns a tree of React components that will eventually render to HTML.

The <div> tags are not actual DOM nodes; they are instantiations of React div components. 
You can think of these as markers or pieces of data that React knows how to handle. React is safe.
